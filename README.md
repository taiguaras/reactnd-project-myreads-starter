# MyReads Project

First Udacity React Nanodegree Project

## MyReads Udacity Template
A template was used to help the development process.
To get the application running right away:

* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the development server with `npm start`

## Description
A simple application where you can track and plan your readings in a small dashboard.
You can categorize books in four kinds of status:

* [`Currently Reading`](#CurrentlyReading)
* [`Want To Read`](#WantToRead)
* [`Read`](#Read)
* [`None`](#None)

## Search
It is also possible to add a new book to any of those status after you locate it through the search method.
Search page can be found at the route `\search` or clicking the plus button.

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.

## Create React App
This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app). You can find more information on how to perform common tasks [here](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/packages/react-scripts/template/README.md).
